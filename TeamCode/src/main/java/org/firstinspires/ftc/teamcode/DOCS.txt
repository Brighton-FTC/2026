# Indexer
Yanni Papadimitriou

There are two versions of the indexer: 1- and 3- sensor.

## 3 Sensor - Lazy
The 3 sensor version works by reading every slot, determining if the ball exists, and if so, its colour, then saves it to the 'colours' array. This uses a simple 3-case enum (GREEN, PURPLE, EMPTY).
Lazy sensing: runs on demand.
Advantages:
 - More performant - does not run every 'update()', causing decreased resources utilisation.
 - More reliable - has a lower chance of failing, mainly through elimination of double readings.

Disadvantages:
 - More expensive - 3 sensors vs 1.

## 1 Sensor - Active
The 1 sensor version works by reading a colour sensor on the intake every update. When it senses a ball, it populates the first empty slot of the array, and blocks until the ball isn't sensed anymore to prevent multiple readings. It unblocks when no more balls are sensed.
Active sensing: runs every update.
Advantages:
 - Less expensive - 1 sensors vs 3

Disadvantages:
 - Less performant - runs every update, wasting resources.
 - Less reliable - higher chance of failing, misread balls are fatal.
